# Sign-up Form Template

A sign-up form template I created from scratch as part of [The Odin Project's](https://www.theodinproject.com/) full stack curriculum â€“ specifically, [this](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-sign-up-form) module. The form includes basic validation checks.
